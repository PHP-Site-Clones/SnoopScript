# SnoopScript 1.0
## Themes
Themes are basically different versions. We have 2 people on the team, and the code maybe different on both themes. We'll update our own themes, you can even mash the themes code together.
## Vulnerability
If you using SQL to store these, you'll have to make your own database, sanitize inputs, and even make sure you have zero vulns. Will there be SQL support ever? Maybe.
## Help
